**1. Project Overview and Objectives**
The objective of this project was to develop a foundational Student Information System in Java. This project focuses on utilizing basic Java syntax, variables, and the Scanner class to capture and display essential student data.

Technical Requirements Met

Data Capture: Implemented a system to store and display student details including Name, Age, Grade, and Contact Information.

Input Handling: Utilized java.util.Scanner to facilitate interactive console-based data entry.

Fundamental Syntax: Applied proper Java naming conventions and variable types (e.g., String, int, double) to manage information efficiently.

**2. Setup and Installation Instructions**

JDK Version: Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher is installed.

IDE: Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.

Compilation: Compile the source code located in the src/ folder.

Execution: Run the Main.java file.

User Manual: When the console prompts you, enter the student's name, age, current grade, and contact details. The system will then echo back a formatted summary of the student record.

**3. Code Structure Explanation**

The project is designed to demonstrate procedural logic within a class-based structure.

:>Input Module-Uses the Scanner class to read user-provided strings and integers from the console.

:>Storage Variables-Local variables in the main method (or fields in a Student class) hold the details during execution.

:>Display Logic-Formats the stored data into a readable profile summary using System.out.printf or println.

**4. Technical Requirements Explanation:**

:>Variables & Constants-Used specific data types to ensure data integrity (e.g., age as an integer, grade as a double/char).

:>Console I/O: Demonstrated the ability to bridge the gap between user input and program storage.

:>String Concatenation: Effectively combined static labels with dynamic variables to create a user-friendly output.
